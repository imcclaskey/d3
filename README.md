# i3 - Ideate, Instruct, Implement!

i3 is a CLI tool for orchestrating more intentional, AI-driven development workflows within Cursor. This tool imposes a structured, phase-based process managed directly from your terminal. By acting as an agent control system for Cursor, `i3` aims to:

*   **Standardize Feature Creation:** Introduce rigor and predictability into the AI development lifecycle.
*   **Isolate Development Stages:** Enforce a clear, intentional separation between defining the problem (Ideation), planning the solution (Instruction), and generating the code (Implementation).
*   **Optimize AI Interaction:** Tailor context and directives for the AI agent in each phase, enhancing the quality and relevance of its contributions.

The core workflow progresses through three distinct phases managed via the `i3` CLI:

- **Ideation**: Collaboratively define the problem, goals, and requirements using AI, focusing strictly on *what* and *why*.
- **Instruction**: Translate the ideation into a detailed, technical blueprint for the AI to follow.
- **Implementation**: Guide the AI to generate code based on the precise instructions, ensuring alignment with the plan.
