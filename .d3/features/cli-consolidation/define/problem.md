**Problem Statement**

The current method for initializing the d3 environment via an AI agent tool call (`mcp_tool_init`) can lead to inconsistencies, particularly with resolving the correct working directory for `mcp.json`. This makes it difficult to reliably ensure the d3 server information is correctly registered. Additionally, there's no straightforward mechanism to "refresh" an existing d3 environment to ensure all necessary files and directories are present without overwriting user-generated content.

**Feature Goals**

1.  Ensure reliable and accurate initialization of the d3 environment, including correct `mcp.json` configuration with the proper working directory.
2.  Provide a mechanism to refresh an existing d3 environment, creating any missing standard files and directories without data loss.
3.  Consolidate the d3 initialization logic into a user-facing CLI command.

**Core Requirements**

1.  The `init` CLI command MUST accurately determine and use the current working directory where it is executed.
2.  The `init` CLI command MUST create or update the `mcp.json` file, ensuring the d3 server information and working directory are correctly registered.
3.  The `init` CLI command MUST include a "refresh" capability.
4.  The "refresh" capability MUST verify and create any missing standard d3 project structure elements (e.g., `.gitignore`, `.cursor/rules/d3`, `.d3/features`).
5.  The "refresh" capability MUST NOT delete or overwrite existing user-generated content within the d3 project structure.
6.  A user MUST NOT be able to initialize a d3 project by any means other than the `init` CLI command.
