# Problem Statement
Users are unable to delete existing features within the system, lacking this capability in both the Command Line Interface (CLI) and the Management Control Plane (MCP) tools.

# Feature Goals
*   Enable users to delete features via the CLI.
*   Enable users to delete features via MCP tools.
*   Ensure the deletion process is clear and provides appropriate feedback to the user.
*   Ensure the deletion process comprehensively removes all relevant feature artifacts from the system.

# Core Requirements
*   **CLI:**
    *   User can issue a command specifying a feature to be deleted.
    *   System prompts for confirmation before proceeding with the deletion.
    *   System provides clear feedback to the user indicating successful deletion or any errors encountered.
*   **MCP Tools:**
    *   User can select an existing feature for deletion through the MCP interface.
    *   System presents a confirmation step before executing the deletion.
    *   System provides clear visual feedback on the status and outcome of the deletion process (e.g., success, failure).
*   **General:**
    *   System removes all uniquely associated files, configurations, and data linked to the specified feature.
    *   System ensures that the deletion of one feature does not inadvertently affect other unrelated features.

# Scope Exclusions
*   Archiving or "soft-deleting" features (deletion is intended to be permanent).
*   Complex role-based access control for the deletion functionality (assume users with general access to modify features can delete, unless specified otherwise).
*   An "undo" or "rollback" mechanism for feature deletion.
*   Automatic backup of features prior to deletion (this can be considered if deemed critical, but is initially out of scope).
