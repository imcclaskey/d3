# Feature: test

## 1. Problem Statement

The project currently lacks automated unit tests. This absence increases the risk of regressions when making changes, hinders code refactoring, and makes it difficult to verify the correctness of individual components.

## 2. Feature Goals

*   Establish a comprehensive unit testing suite for the project.
*   Achieve significant test coverage across all core packages and modules.
*   Ensure tests cover common use cases (happy paths) and known edge cases for critical components.

## 3. Core Requirements

*   Implement unit tests for core project functionalities.
*   Integrate test execution into the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run automatically before build steps.
*   *TODO: Add other essential capabilities...*

## 4. Scope Exclusions

*   Integration testing between different services or components.
*   End-to-end (E2E) testing simulating full user workflows.
*   Performance, load, or stress testing.
*   Security vulnerability scanning or penetration testing.
*   Testing of third-party library internals (unless using mocks/stubs).

## 5. Unresolved Dependencies/Questions (Optional)

*   Is there a specific target metric for "significant test coverage" (e.g., percentage)?
*   Are there known areas of the codebase that are particularly difficult to unit test and might require preliminary refactoring (which could affect scope/effort)?
*   Confirmation required on the specific CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions workflow file) where the test step should be added.
