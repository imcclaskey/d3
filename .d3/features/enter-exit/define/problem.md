# Feature: Enter-Exit

## Problem Statement
Users of d3 currently lack a clear and consistent mechanism to **enter** and **exit** features. This hinders the ability to pause and resume work on a specific feature, or to switch contexts between different features effectively, creating friction in the development workflow.

## Feature Goals
- Enable users to exit a feature without losing its state or context
- Allow users to resume work on a previously exited feature from its last active phase
- Provide a smooth transition between different features in the d3 framework
- Maintain consistent user experience throughout feature transitions

## Core Requirements
- User can exit the current feature, which effectively exits the d3 environment
- User can enter a previously exited feature and resume at the last active phase
- System must preserve feature state when exiting a feature
- System must track the last active phase of each feature
- User can view available features that can be entered
- Transitions between features must be seamless and intuitive

## Scope Exclusions
- Managing or modifying feature content during transitions
- Creating new features during the enter/exit process
- Concurrent work on multiple features simultaneously
- Automatic feature state backups or versioning
- Complex state management beyond tracking the active phase

## Unresolved Dependencies/Questions
- How should the system handle unsaved changes when exiting a feature?
- What metadata beyond the phase needs to be preserved for each feature?
- Should there be confirmation steps before exiting a feature?
- How should the user experience be designed for feature selection when entering?
