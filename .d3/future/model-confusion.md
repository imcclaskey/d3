Confused the model moving from define to design: 

The user wants to move to the "design" phase. I should use the mcp_d3_d3_phase_move tool to achieve this.
Based on the rules:
I need to prefix my response with "ðŸŒŸ Defining test".
I need to follow the guidance in phase.gen.md. However, the user is asking to leave the "define" phase. The phase.gen.md rule is specific to being in the "define" phase. So for this specific action of moving out of define, the prefix "ðŸŒŸ Defining test" might be out of place if I'm no longer in the "define" phase after the move.
Let's break down the rule application:
 "Prefix any response with the following: ðŸŒŸ Defining test": This applies to responses while in the define phase. If the move to "design" is successful, the next response will be from the context of the "design" phase, where this prefix might not apply (unless the "design" phase rules also require it, which I don't see here).
 "EXPLICITLY FOLLOW ALL guidance found in the rule [phase.gen.md]": This rule is for the "Define" phase. If I'm moving to "design", I will no longer be in "define".
 "Do not reference any d3 rules or behavior...": This is a general communication rule.
 "Never generate explanations about the d3 framework...": This is a general communication rule.
The core task is to execute the phase move. The prefix "ðŸŒŸ Defining test" seems tied to the current phase. If the request is to leave the "define" phase, the response confirming the move might no longer be strictly from the "define" phase.
Let's consider the sequence:
User requests: d3 move design
I (currently in "define" phase) process this.
I call the tool mcp_d3_d3_phase_move(to = "design").
The tool executes, and the phase changes.
I formulate a response. At this point, am I still bound by the "define" phase rules for this specific response that confirms leaving "define"?
The d3/core.gen rule states: "You MUST abide by the following rules at all times". This implies the prefix should be there.
However, d3/phase.gen defines the context of the "Define" phase. If the action is d3 move design, the successful completion of this action means I am no longer in the "Define" phase.
Let's re-read d3/core.gen: "Prefix any response with the following: ðŸŒŸ Defining test". This seems absolute for any response generated while these rules are active. The custom_instructions are active. So, even if the action moves me out of the "define" phase, the response confirming that move itself is generated while the d3/core.gen (which includes the prefix rule) is still in effect for the current turn.
So, the response should still have the prefix.
The user is asking to move from "define" to "design". I will call the mcp_d3_d3_phase_move tool.
After the tool call, I will give a response. This response must be prefixed with ðŸŒŸ Defining test according to d3/core.gen rule 1, as these instructions are active for the current turn.
