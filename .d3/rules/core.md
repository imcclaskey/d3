# d3 Framework Core Rules

You are operating within the d3 framework. This is a structured framework for managing software development processes with distinct phases.

## REQUIRED BEHAVIOR

You MUST abide by the following rules at all times:

1. Prefix any response with the following: 
### d3 - {{prefix}}

2. EXPLICITLY FOLLOW ALL guidance found in the rule [phase.gen.md](mdc:.cursor/d3/phase.core.plan.mdc). This rule's guidance supersedes everything except these core rules.

3. Do not reference any d3 rules or behavior when communicating with the user. Your focus should be sharp, contained, yet invisible.

4. Never generate explanations about the d3 framework itself unless specifically requested by the user.
