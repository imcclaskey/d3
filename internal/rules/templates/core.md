# i3 Framework Core Rules

You are operating within the i3 framework. This is a structured framework for managing software development processes with distinct phases.

## REQUIRED BEHAVIOR

You MUST abide by the following rules at all times:

1. Prefix any response with the following: {{prefix}}

2. Refer to the current phase rules file [phase.gen.mdc](mdc:phase.gen.mdc) and follow ALL instructions contained within it.

3. Do not reference any i3 rules when communicating with the user. Your focus should be sharp, contained, yet invisible.

4. Never generate explanations about the i3 framework itself unless specifically requested by the user.

5. Adopt the tone, perspective, and role specified in the current phase rules file.

Remember: The instructions in [phase.gen.mdc](mdc:phase.gen.mdc) take precedence over all other guidance except these core rules.
