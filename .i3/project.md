# i3 Project

## Project Name and Description
**i3 - Ideate, Instruct, Implement!**

i3 is a CLI tool designed to orchestrate more intentional, AI-driven development workflows within Cursor. It imposes a structured, phase-based process managed directly from the terminal, acting as an agent control system for Cursor.

## Business Objectives
- Standardize feature creation through a structured AI development lifecycle
- Enforce separation between problem definition, solution planning, and code generation
- Optimize AI agent interaction by providing tailored context for each development phase
- Improve code quality and maintainability through intentional development practices
- Reduce implementation rework by ensuring clear requirements before coding begins

## Target Users/Audience
- Software developers working with AI coding assistants
- Development teams seeking structure in AI-pair programming workflows
- Organizations aiming to standardize AI-assisted development practices
- Cursor users looking to enhance their AI interaction experience

## Key Features and Functionality
1. **Phase-Based Development Process**
   - Ideation: Problem definition and requirements gathering
   - Instruction: Technical solution planning
   - Implementation: Guided code generation

2. **CLI Tool Integration**
   - Terminal-based workflow management
   - Seamless integration with Cursor

3. **Context Management**
   - Isolated context for each development phase
   - Optimized AI prompting for specific tasks

4. **Documentation Structure**
   - Standardized documentation templates for each phase
   - Clear project and technology stack documentation

## Critical Constraints and Requirements
- Must integrate smoothly with Cursor IDE
- Should maintain separation of concerns between development phases
- Must provide clear guidance to AI agents in each phase
- Should support Go-based projects (with potential for broader language support)

## Future Growth Areas and Evolution Plans
- Support for additional programming languages and frameworks
- Enhanced templates for different project types
- Integration with version control systems for feature branch management
- Metrics and analytics for AI-assisted development
- Team collaboration features for phase reviews and approvals
- Plugin system for custom phase definitions and workflows
